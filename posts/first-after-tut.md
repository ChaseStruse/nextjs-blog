summary: 'My thoughts after doing the Next.js tutorial'

After following the amazing tutorial setup on the Next.js website I have finally created a blog website. Next.js is already becoming my favorite React framework. It takes all of the great features of react and creates a great backend system that allows you to take your development to the next level. 

Even though I have very limited experience in Next.js I am already falling in love with the way it does fonts, routing, and rendering. In regards to fonts Next makes it so easy to import your own custom fonts and get this, it allows you to swap fonts without having the weird layout changes that you probably have seen before. For some info on how to use fonts checkout the `Notes.md` file located in the github directory. 

The most useful feature I have found with Next.js is its ability to smoothly and dynamically be able to set urls. Like it almost feels like magic. If you look at the files on github checkout pages/posts/[id] and you can see an instance of its incredible dynamic url generation. I mean what more is there to say? It's just incredible!

Next.js also allows for two different types of rendering which you can find in the static generation vs server side rendering. For more info on all of this you can also checkout `Notes.md` and see my notes regarding it.
